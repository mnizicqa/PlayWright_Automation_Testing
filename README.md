# Playwright Automation Testing Framework

This is a project which I have done to learn Playwright testing framework. The goal of the project was to create Playwright automation framework to showcase what I have learned. Tests are written using Playwright version 1.43.0. There are both positive and negative test cases.Also API testing was conducted, as well as network response mocking, as well as network request intercept. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 123. Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Page Object Model was used for creating and organizing test structure.

You can install all of the dependencies using command in the terminal **npm install**. To run the Cypress, just use the command **npx playwright test project=select one of the projects in playwright config file**. All of the scripts for running tests are in the **package.json** file. Also, you can create reports by using npm scripts, which are provided in the **package.json** file. Both HTML report and Allure reports are enabled. Also, Cucumber.js framework is provided for installation in the package.json file. To run Cucumber tests use the terminal command **npx cucumber-js --exit** or script provided in the **package.json** file.
